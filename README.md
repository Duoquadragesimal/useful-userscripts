# useful-userscripts
#### FOR BROWSERS
To install a userscript, you first need to download  the user script manager [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (or [Userscript](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/userscripts/id1463298887) for Safari - Note: Turns out this does work! Just make sure to copy the script in and save). 
If using Tampermonkey, open the raw link to the script (found below) and Tampermonkey should detect that it is a userscript. Then just click install.
If using Userscript for Safari, you may have to copy the script from the link below and paste into a script in the Userscript plugin.  Then click save.
